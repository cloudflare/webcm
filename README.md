WebCM is a proxy server implementation of a [Components
Manager](https://managedcomponents.dev/getting-started/components-manager). It
works independently from your existing HTTP server. By proxying your server, it
can add endpoints, execute server-side code, manipulate responses and
more. These capabilities allow for a very performant way to load Managed
Components.

## Usage

> ðŸ’¡ **Prerequisite:** The best way to run WebCM is using Bun. You can
> then install all dependencies with `bun i`.

It's very easy to get up and running with WebCM using `bunx`!

1. Create a `webcm.config.ts` config file (use
   [example.config.ts](./example.config.ts) as an example)
2. Run `bunx --bun 'github:cloudflare/webcm#bun' `
3. WebCM will automatically download the Managed Components you specified and
   start the server

## Develop

1. `git clone git@github.com:cloudflare/webcm.git && cd webcm && bun i`
2. Create a `webcm.config.ts` config file (use
   [example.config.ts](./example.config.ts) as an example)
3. Run `bun run dev`

## Build your own Managed Components

You might want to make WebCM load a locally developed Managed Component.

To do so, run:

```bash
bunx --bun 'github:cloudflare/webcm#bun' path/to/component.ts
```

This will run the component on a simple static site, with all permissions
enabled. If you want to proxy a different website, pass the URL as another CLI
argument:

```bash
bunx --bun 'github:cloudflare/webcm#bun' path/to/component.ts https://example.com
```

To pass custom settings to that component, use `--settings_<settingName>` flags,
like so:

```bash
bunx --bun 'github:cloudflare/webcm#bun' path/to/component.ts --settings_apiKey=xxxxxxxxx
```

To test the component with different permissions, create a `webcm.config.ts`
(see [example.config.ts](./example.config.ts)) and set it to:

```ts
export default {
  components: [
    {
      path: './path/to/component.ts',
      permissions: ['execute_unsafe_scripts'],
    },
  ],
}
```
